# Smooth-Transition
🌟 Major Project 1: Dynamic Section Transitions 🚀 Created a seamless toggle between White and Black sections using HTML, CSS, and React. Smooth transitions, state management with React’s useState, and a centered layout via CSS Flexbox bring this project to life. Phrases like “Welcome to my Project” make it uniquely mine.
